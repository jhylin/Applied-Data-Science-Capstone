# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
This repository contains all the work involved in the lead up to the final capstone project in my data science course (all in Jupyter notebook formats). The order to read should follow exactly as how it was numbered, which showed the workflow involved in analysing data on rocket launches. A final powerpoint slide was also prepared (but I didn't include it in here in case this may violate the course assignment rule, as it required each student's own interpretations and communication styles).
