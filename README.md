# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
This repository contains all the work involved (in Jupyter notebook formats) in the final capstone project in my professional data science course. The order to read should follow exactly as how it was numbered, which showed a workflow relating to analysing data on rocket launches. A final powerpoint slide was also prepared (but I didn't include it in here in case this may violate the course assignment rule, which required student's own interpretations and communication styles).
