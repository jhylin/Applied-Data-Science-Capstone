# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone
This repository contains most of the work involved in the lead up to the final capstone project in my data science course (all in Jupyter notebook formats). The order to read should follow exactly as how it's numbered, which shows the workflow involved in analysing data on rocket launches. A final powerpoint slide was also prepared, but I didn't include it in here, in case this might violate the course assignment rule, which required each student's interpretations and communication styles.
